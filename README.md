### Hi there, your're welcome! 👋

 #### Hello, guys
 ---

- :mortar_board:  Undergraduate in the final year of Economics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). 
- :office:  I am currently working as a researcher in the Social Observatory research group linked to the economics department at UFSCar.
- 🔭 My research interests include labor economics and labor markets (including informality and child labor), child labor, cash transfer programs, and the impact evaluation of social policies.
- 💻 My projects involve R and Stata. I am creating an “open book” that is constantly evolving, where I document what I learn. It grows over time as I work on new analyses, containing syntaxes, workflows, and applied empirical examples. It is continuously updated as I develop new projects.
