### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**brunotimm/brunotimm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-    Iâ€™m Undergraduate in the final year of Economics at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos. 
-    Iâ€™m currently working on as RA at FGV EESP CLEAR
- ğŸ”­ My projects involve the R and Stata languages. I'm currently building a learning repository for Stata and finalizing one for R
